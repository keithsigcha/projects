#WALMART SALES EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS


Used SQL and python to gain deeper knowledge of the dataset, visualize the dataset in a more efficient and help with answering business like questions related to the dataset.

#DESCRIPTION

Donwloaded the walmart dataset from Kaggle that included information about how much each customer spent money on each product line and how much quantity they bought of a certain product and other key informations about customers. I used SQL to breakdown the dataset to figure out valuable information such as which city had the most revenue, what is the most common payment method among men and women, and other important information that can be seen in the SQL file I attached to this repository. 

Then, I used python's library panda and jupyter notebook in order to better visualize the dataset such as to figure out the datatype of each column, the headers of the dataset, and to calculate staistics values of the dataset such as the mean , median , standard deviation,minimum, and maximum value. I also used python's library pandas and jupyter notebook to create changes to the dataset based on condtions and requirements and created a finalized list that includes customers who bought more than 7 units and have a tax > 30 dollars.
